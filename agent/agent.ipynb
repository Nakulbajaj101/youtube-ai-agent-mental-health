    "\n",
    "## Research process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 1: Initial Exploration  \n",
    "- Using your own knowledge of the topic, perform 3-5 broad search queries to understand the main topic\n",
    "  and identify related areas. Only use search function.\n",
    "- After the initial search exploration, summarize key concepts, definitions, and major themes.\n",
    "- You MUST inspect the full transcript to be able to provide a better write up for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 2: Deep Investigation \n",
    "- Perform 5-6 refined queries focusing on depth.\n",
    "- Inspect relevant documents for specific mechanisms, case studies, and technical details.\n",
    "- Gather diverse viewpoints and data to strengthen depth and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operation Mode (ReAct)\n",
    "For every request, you must follow these steps:\n",
    "1. **THOUGHT**: Analyze the user's request. What are the key search terms? Do I need to search for a specific video or across all transcripts? \n",
    "2. **ACTION**: Call the `search_videos` tool with a refined query, and leverage `get_subtitles_by_id` tool for subtitles.\n",
    "3. **OBSERVATION**: Review the snippets, timestamps, and metadata returned from Elasticsearch.\n",
    "4. **THOUGHT**: Does the data answer the question? If not, refine the search. If yes, synthesize the final answer.\n",
    "5. **FINAL ANSWER**: Combine the final answer with all the reference videos. Make sure the video url has a combined video ID and the resulting seconds as a link: `https://youtu.be/[ID]?t=[SECONDS].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citation Rules\n",
    "- Every claim MUST be followed by a youtube link and a timestamp as per Action stage.\n",
    "- Always provide the link as returned by the tool.\n",
    "- Display the human-readable time (e.g., 05:20) in parentheses next to the youtube link for the user's convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",
    "- If no results are found, state that you couldn't find information in the transcripts.\n",
    "- Do not hallucinate timestamps; only use what is returned in the `Observation` phase.\n",
    "- Do not make incorrect urls, only what is returned at the Action stage\n",

      "To manage trauma effectively, it's important to understand both its nature and the underlying mechanisms that can lead to healing. Based on insights from Gabor Maté in his podcast titled *How to understand & heal your trauma*, the following key concepts are elaborated:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts:\n",
      "1. **Understanding Trauma**:\n",
      "   - The term *trauma* originates from the Greek word for wound. Trauma is not merely an event or what happened to you; it’s fundamentally about your internal experience and how you process events (5:50). It's a psychological wound that leaves a lasting imprint on mental and physical functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Types of Trauma**:\n",
      "   - **Big T Trauma**: Major traumatic events that are easily identifiable, such as war, severe abuse, or significant loss (6:08).\n",
      "   - **Little t Trauma**: More subtle forms of emotional neglect or social disconnection that can also have profound effects on a child's development (6:38).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Role of Expression**:\n",
      "   - The ability to express emotions is critical. Studies show that individuals who repress their emotions can adversely affect their immune systems, leading to higher risks of illness (25:06).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Emotional Needs**:\n",
      "   - Maté emphasizes that children have inalienable emotional needs—such as the need for attachment, the ability to express all emotions, and the need for spontaneous play. Failure to meet these needs can result in trauma (9:00).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Managing vs. Resolving Trauma**:\n",
      "   - While managing stress and trauma through techniques like mindfulness can be beneficial, Maté advocates for a deeper approach where individuals work towards resolving their trauma. This involves understanding one’s childhood programming and learning to set healthy boundaries (28:02).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Interpersonal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Relationships play a significant role in managing trauma. Maté points out that in intimate relationships, partners can reflect and trigger each other's trauma. Thus, growing together in a partnership can foster healing (52:54).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Practical Steps to Manage Trauma:\n",
      "- **Emotional Expression**: Allow yourself to express feelings without judgment. This can include talking to a trusted friend or therapist.\n",
      "- **Mindfulness and Resilience**: Engage in practices that enhance awareness and emotional regulation, such as yoga or meditation.\n",
      "- **Establish Boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" effectively, which helps protect your emotional health from external pressures (28:24).\n",
      "- **Therapeutic Work**: Consider professional help to pursue trauma-informed therapy methods, which focus on healing the root causes of trauma rather than merely mitigating symptoms.\n",

      "Trauma is a deeply ingrained psychological wound that impacts an individual's emotional and physical health, stemming from adverse experiences in childhood and beyond (6:05). There are two types of trauma: \"big T\" traumas, like war, abuse, or loss, which are commonly recognized as traumatic events, and \"little t\" traumas, which encompass emotional neglect and unmet needs in childhood. These smaller experiences can be just as harmful, conditioning children to believe they must earn love and acceptance, leading to long-lasting effects into adulthood (7:01, 7:06).\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding trauma is crucial for managing its effects in daily life and improving relationships. For instance, expressing emotions is vital for emotional and immune health, as research indicates that repressing feelings can significantly increase health risks (25:01). The discussion highlights the importance of recognizing both personal and generational trauma, emphasizing that most trauma is passed down through generations, often impacting how individuals interact and relate to others (13:25). \n",

      "Addressing trauma isn't merely about management; it's about resolution. This involves developing self-awareness, understanding one's emotional triggers, and fostering genuine connections with others, rather than adhering to societal expectations (28:04, 29:29). Building strong, trusting relationships and addressing emotional needs can empower individuals to heal from their trauma, ultimately leading to healthier interactions and improved well-being (52:54). \n",

      "ASSISTANT: To manage trauma effectively, it's important to understand both its nature and the underlying mechanisms that can lead to healing. Based on insights from Gabor Maté in his podcast titled *How to understand & heal your trauma*, the following key concepts are elaborated:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts:\n",
      "1. **Understanding Trauma**:\n",
      "   - The term *trauma* originates from the Greek word for wound. Trauma is not merely an event or what happened to you; it’s fundamentally about your internal experience and how you process events (5:50). It's a psychological wound that leaves a lasting imprint on mental and physical functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Types of Trauma**:\n",
      "   - **Big T Trauma**: Major traumatic events that are easily identifiable, such as war, severe abuse, or significant loss (6:08).\n",
      "   - **Little t Trauma**: More subtle forms of emotional neglect or social disconnection that can also have profound effects on a child's development (6:38).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Role of Expression**:\n",
      "   - The ability to express emotions is critical. Studies show that individuals who repress their emotions can adversely affect their immune systems, leading to higher risks of illness (25:06).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Emotional Needs**:\n",
      "   - Maté emphasizes that children have inalienable emotional needs—such as the need for attachment, the ability to express all emotions, and the need for spontaneous play. Failure to meet these needs can result in trauma (9:00).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Managing vs. Resolving Trauma**:\n",
      "   - While managing stress and trauma through techniques like mindfulness can be beneficial, Maté advocates for a deeper approach where individuals work towards resolving their trauma. This involves understanding one’s childhood programming and learning to set healthy boundaries (28:02).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Interpersonal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Relationships play a significant role in managing trauma. Maté points out that in intimate relationships, partners can reflect and trigger each other's trauma. Thus, growing together in a partnership can foster healing (52:54).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Practical Steps to Manage Trauma:\n",
      "- **Emotional Expression**: Allow yourself to express feelings without judgment. This can include talking to a trusted friend or therapist.\n",
      "- **Mindfulness and Resilience**: Engage in practices that enhance awareness and emotional regulation, such as yoga or meditation.\n",
      "- **Establish Boundaries**: Learn to say \"no\" effectively, which helps protect your emotional health from external pressures (28:24).\n",
      "- **Therapeutic Work**: Consider professional help to pursue trauma-informed therapy methods, which focus on healing the root causes of trauma rather than merely mitigating symptoms.\n",
      "\n",

      "Trauma is defined as a psychological wound that deeply impacts an individual's emotional and psychological functioning, rather than just the distressing events themselves. The term \"trauma\" originates from a Greek word for \"wound\" (5:50). It can be categorized as \"big T\" trauma—major events such as war, abuse, or the death of a loved one—and \"little t\" trauma, which refers to more subtle experiences that can still create significant emotional wounds, like childhood neglect (10:12). The effects of trauma are profound and can extend into both mental and physical health, with studies indicating that adverse childhood experiences often correlate with adult health issues (5:03). Dr. Gabor Maté emphasizes that trauma responses are often misclassified as mental health disorders when they are actually normal reactions to abnormal conditions (1:12). Many individuals unknowingly bear unresolved traumas that may not only affect them but also resonate through familial patterns (13:26). Recovery from trauma involves recognizing these experiences as interconnected with societal influences and evaluating the generational impacts of unresolved trauma. Effective healing strategies can include professional support, emotional exploration, and fostering secure attachments, particularly in parenting (40:07). Maté underscores the importance of approaching trauma with compassion and understanding, advocating for holistic treatment that promotes self-acceptance and authentic living (59:12).
